# CryptoApp - Message and Image Encryption Software
## Overview
CryptoApp is a Java-based application designed for secure encryption and decryption of both text messages and images. It provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting sensitive information, ensuring confidentiality and privacy.

## Features
- Text Encryption and Decryption: Securely encrypt and decrypt text messages using AES encryption.
- Image Encryption and Decryption: Encrypt images to protect visual content and decrypt them for viewing.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design with a gradient background and responsive controls for seamless user experience.
- Dynamic Image Handling: Supports image input and displays a key icon, enhancing visual interaction.

## Technologies Used
- Java: Core programming language for application development.
- Swing: Java GUI toolkit for building the user interface.
- Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA): For implementing AES encryption and decryption.
- ImageIO: For image processing and manipulation.
  
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) for running the Java application
  
### Installation
